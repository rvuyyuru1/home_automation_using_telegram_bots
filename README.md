$ sudo apt install npm
$ npm install node-dht-sensor onoff node-telegram-bot

The available commands are:

 /getouts, shows the actual status of the two relays
 /setout1 ON|OFF, /setout2 ON|OFF, sets one of the outputs to ON or OFF
 /gettemp, shows the actual temperature
 /gethum, shows the actual humidity

Security:

Telegram bots are public, that means that every user can send messages to them.
 To be sure that my bot will answer only to me,
 I added in the code a check on the ID of the user that is sending commands to the bot:
 

 $ sudo node user.js
 
 $sudo node bot.js
  
  
creating bot in Telegram:
  We can do a lot of stuff with bots. The first step in creating our bot is to talk to the BotFather

  
  Type in the search form BotFather.
  
  Click on the BotFather and a chat container will be opened so we can chat with him. 
  Hit the start button which will display a list of commands that we can use to interact with the BotFather.
 
 Let’s create our bot using the command 
 /newbot 
 It is going to ask for a name for our bot, so we’ll call our bot RajaBot.
 
 Now we have to register for a username, note: it must end in bot, If our bot is named RajaBot the username must be rajabot.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 BotFather will congratulate us, and give a link to our bot telegram.me/raja_bot.
 Using one of the commands above, we can make various changes to our bot. 
 But, right now, the most important command is /token, as it will give us an API token to access our bot through HTTPS. Go ahead and type that now:
 
 
 /token
 
 
 
 
 
 The return value will look something like this: 197372558:AAEtvechentOstoPmVyb1_aF2Dbe7k
